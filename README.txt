About this project: This project is a hardened flask website that implements different user access and encryption to show different pages
and functionality. The database will be created when the file is ran and each user can log in if they are a previous user. For a security level 
3 access the following credentials should be functional in order for you to create your own users and test as needed. There is full functionality.
username: sofia
password: test

Assumptions: Users will type in valid input in each text box. The website is ran properly just by running the name of file (appEncryption2.py) in terminal
All work below was performed solely by Sofia Bernal.
I did use code generated by an AI tool.
